## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Components**: 100
- **Complete**: 23 (23.0%)
- **In Progress**: 1 (1.0%) 
- **Needs Work**: 76 (76.0%)

## Current Status

**Currently working on**: Converting basic class instantiation tests to comprehensive newSpecPage tests

**Recently completed**:
1. ✅ **avatar** - Enhanced from basic tests to 37 comprehensive tests covering props, sizes, colors, upload functionality, events, accessibility 
2. ✅ **card** - Enhanced from basic tests to 21 comprehensive tests covering props, states, events, accessibility, edge cases
3. ✅ **chip** - Enhanced from basic tests to 28 comprehensive tests covering variants, states, icons, deletable functionality, events
4. ✅ **autocomplete** - Already had comprehensive tests (600+ lines)

**Next priorities**:
1. Continue with card-related components (card-body, card-header, etc.)
2. Improve avatar-group tests (complex component with dependencies)
3. Work through chip component family
4. Continue alphabetically through remaining basic tests

## Notes

- DO NOT MODIFY ANY COMPONENT, YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT TESTS ONLY. IF NEEDED, MOCK COMPONENTS DEPENDENCIES BUT AVOID EDITING THEM.
- Components with comprehensive tests already implemented: accordion, accordion-body, accordion-group, accordion-header, alert, badge, divider, icon, icon-button, paper, theme-provider, typo, warning
- Alert component tests achieved perfect coverage (100% statements, branches, functions, and lines)
- Most components only have basic creation and render tests that need to be enhanced
- Upload component appears to have no test file
- run tests with:
```bash
npx stencil test --spec src/components/<componentPath> --coverage
```
