## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Components**: 100
- **Complete**: 19 (19.0%)
- **In Progress**: 0 (0%)
- **Needs Work**: 81 (81.0%)

## Current Status

**Currently working on**: alert component (improving basic tests to comprehensive coverage)

**Next priorities**:
1. Improve alert component tests to comprehensive coverage
2. Continue with alert-related components (alert-actions, alert-body, alert-header)
3. Continue alphabetically through remaining components with basic tests

## Notes

- DO NOT MODIFY ANY COMPONENT, YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT TESTS ONLY. IF NEEDED, MOCK COMPONENTS DEPENDENCIES BUT AVOID EDITING THEM.
- Components with comprehensive tests already implemented: accordion, accordion-body, accordion-group, accordion-header, alert, badge, divider, icon, icon-button, paper, theme-provider, typo, warning
- Alert component tests achieved perfect coverage (100% statements, branches, functions, and lines)
- Most components only have basic creation and render tests that need to be enhanced
- Upload component appears to have no test file
- run tests with:
```bash
npx stencil test --spec src/components/<componentPath> --coverage
```
